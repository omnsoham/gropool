# gropool
Started with sokul_13 as part of an initiative to decrease contact during the earlier stages of our pandemic through grocery carpooling.
It also was our first attempt at creating a website. The project was developed during 2020's summer, and is based on Django (a popular python web framework).
The calendar html is from a w3 schools tutorial and most of the site's unneeded visual interativity (css and js) are from a youtube tutorial. We mainly focused on the backend, django website structure, and html aspects of the project.
