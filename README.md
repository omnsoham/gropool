# gropool
kulom007 and sokul_13 started this as part of an initiative to decrease contact during the earlier stages of our pandemic through grocery carpooling, after recieving VC funding for our idea.
It also was our first attempt at creating a website. The project was developed during 2020's summer, and is based on Django (a popular python web framework).
The calendar html is from a w3 schools tutorial and most of the site's unneeded visual interativity (css and js) are from a youtube tutorial. We mainly focused on the backend, django website structure, and html aspects of the project.
